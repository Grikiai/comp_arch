# Computer Architecture course @ MIF
Basically four tasks:
1. ALU design - canbe found in CPU dir, as this was a prerequisite for designing a simple CPU
2. CPU design
3. Intel86x64 assembler for a simple sort
4. the same for RISC-V

Had a lot of fun while designing simple CPU operations. Opcode list is provided in txt file.
Unfortunaltelly, whole CPU design was lost, i hope one day ill find or recreate it. To peek at design tasks use Logism. For RISC-V code, we used RARS.
