# Computer Architecture course @ MIF
Basically four tasks:
1. ALU design 
2. CPU design - lost mine, might recreate in the future.
3. Intel86x64 assembler for a simple sort
4. the same for RISC-V

Had a lot of fun while designing simple CPU operations. Unfortunaltelly, whole cpu design was lost, i hope one day ill find it or recreate. For design tasks use logism.
